Hi! I’m Albert, I’m currently a PhD Candidate at Delft University of Technology, specializing in **Tensor Network Machine Learning** advised by Prof. Dr. ir. Kim Batselier.

My research is focused on **Tensor Network-based methods** to leverage their potential to enhance the efficiency of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** models while maintaining expressiveness. My work explores the intersection of **Bayesian probabilistic models** and **large-scale ML architectures**, aiming to develop more efficient, interpretable, and scalable AI systems.

Additionally, I work on **Uncertainty Estimation** techniques, incorporating Bayesian approaches to improve model reliability, robustness, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Beyond academia, I have extensive experience applying ML principles to real-world applications, particularly in **Recommender Systems**. My expertise spans the full ML pipeline, from data processing (SQL, Pandas, PySpark) to scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy) and model development (Python, PyTorch, JAX, scikit-learn, LLM-based technologies).
